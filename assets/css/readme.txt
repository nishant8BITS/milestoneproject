<h1>Milestone Project 1 - Design a website for a band</h1> 

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project is a website for a band. The website allows people to view videos of the band playing, see their setlist, read reviews of the band and get in contact with the band by means of a contact form.
   Every professional band needs a website as without one people might find it difficult to get in contact, see videos and view other information about the band.
</p>

<h2> Technologies Used</h2>
<p> This website uses a number of technologies; 
   <ul>
    <li> HTML code was used to build the foundations of the project. It was then styled with CSS.   </li>
    <li> Bootstrap was used to help with the overall layout of the project & style e.g. navbars, contact form layout, social media icons.</li>
    <li> Bootstrap's Font Awesome was used to style phone and email icons in the footer.   </li>
    <li> Cloudflare Hover.Css was used to style the hover on email address and the navbar elements.   </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>The website consists of 6 pages. The navbar at the top of each page and the footer at the bottom are consistent throughout. The first page, the Home page, 
features the band logo and a H1 heading of 'Wedding band and corporate specialists from the North East." This is followed by a short 'about' section that gives some
general information about the band. This is followed by an up-to date video of the band and then a contact form. I put the most important content on the Home or landing page.</p>

<p> Page 2 in the navbar is 'Band'. This page includes 6 images spaced using bootstraps column col-lg-4 so the images are placed 3 accross. People can see who the members of
the band are and some individual information about them.</p>
<p> Page 3 features videos of the band, the full promo video and one song. These videos use <a target="_blank" so the videos open in a separate page and the band website remains open
in a separate tab. </p>

<p> Page 4 is a list of the bands setlist. Its divided into 6 sections using bootstrap columns and unordered list tags. The 6 sections show the band has a diverse setlist.</p>

<p> Page 5 features reviews of the band. I used the "card mb-4 box-shadow" tag to place the reviews in boxes. They feature photos from previous concerts and a testimonial.</p>

<p> Page 6 is the contact form so people can submit a query directly to the band. The direct phone and email number also feature in the footer of the page.  </p>

<h2> Testing - Changes Made</h2>
<p>The project was tested using Google DevTools. I found these extrememly useful in checking code, colour shchemes etc. I also used the live preview tool in Cloud9 to see changes 
I made. To see how user friendly the website was I had family and friends use it. They gave me some very useful tips, one of which being to remove the large logo image 
from each page as it was hard to know which page you were on. This was because each page initially looked the same. I found there was no need for the logo image on each page.
